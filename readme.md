# Immo Agent
No need to find real estate, it finds you! You will hear from Immo Agent soon...

### Project Description

The __Immo Agent__ cleverly connects data that is already available to Raiffeisen and enriches the classical online banking app with an outstanding solution. Intelligent algorithms help to realize your dream of the perfect real estate and will notify you when a good match is found based on your preferences.

We invested in user experience, which is definitely key for this project. The use cases are well-defined and essential parts of the app are already implemented. We have come this far, Rome wasn't build in one day, and we would love to further develop this core idea and create a unique experience for Raiffeisen customers.
